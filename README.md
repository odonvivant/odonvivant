## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Victor Tozzato**, If asked I would probably define myself as a
"Problem solver" 3 of 5 times, there's this itchy feeling in my
brain every time I'm facing any unspecific challenge that triggers
my creativity department and pushes me ahead throughout a very enjoyable
experiment journey.  

Have being coding, modeling and inventing stuff for more than a decade
so far and this took me to the most unexpected places in the world,
quite the adventure I would say.
